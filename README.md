## 🚀 Project Overview

**HealthSight** is a full-stack (ML + data + APIs + reporting) toolkit designed to build, evaluate, and deploy predictive models on clinical and health record data. The aim is to support clinicians, health researchers, and data scientists with end-to-end tools for forecasting patient outcomes (e.g. risk of readmission, mortality, disease progression) using structured and time-series clinical inputs.

Key features include:

- Preprocessing pipelines for common clinical datasets  
- Baseline and advanced predictive modeling (classification, regression, survival)  
- Model evaluation and interpretability tools  
- Deployment scripts / APIs to serve predictions  
- Reporting & dashboard templates for result presentation

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+  
- (Optional) Virtual environment tool (e.g. `venv`, `conda`)  
- Required libraries (see `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/tabishkhan72/HealthSight-Predictive-Analytics-on-Clinical-Data.git
cd HealthSight-Predictive-Analytics-on-Clinical-Data

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

## 🧪 Usage

### 1. Data Preparation & Preprocessing

Use scripts in `scripts/` or notebooks to:

* Clean and impute missing values
* Normalize or scale clinical features
* Encode categorical variables
* Feature engineering (temporal aggregates, lag features, comorbidity scoring)

Example:

```bash
python scripts/preprocess.py --input data/raw/clinical_data.csv --output data/processed/clean_data.csv
```

### 2. Model Training

Train baseline and advanced models:

```bash
python scripts/train.py \
  --train data/processed/clean_data.csv \
  --target “readmission_risk” \
  --model “xgboost” \
  --output models/readmission_model.pkl
```

Options may include models like logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost, or survival models.

### 3. Evaluation & Interpretation

Generate performance metrics and explainable outputs:

```bash
python scripts/evaluate.py \
  --model models/readmission_model.pkl \
  --test data/processed/test_data.csv \
  --report reports/readmission_report.html
```

Visuals include ROC/PR curves, feature importance, SHAP values, calibration plots, etc.

### 4. Serving / API (Optional)

If you include a backend API (in `api/`):

```bash
cd api
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

Then, you can call endpoints like:

```
POST /predict
{ “patient_features”: { … } }
```

## 🧩 Sample Workflow

1. Ingest raw clinical data
2. Preprocess / feature engineer
3. Train multiple candidate models
4. Evaluate & pick the best
5. Package model to serve via API
6. Visualize results in dashboard or report

## ⚙️ Technologies & Libraries

* **Languages:** Python
* **ML / Data:** scikit-learn, XGBoost, pandas, NumPy
* **Interpretability:** SHAP, matplotlib, seaborn
* **API / Web (optional):** FastAPI / Flask

## 🧠 Potential Extensions & Ideas

* Add **time-to-event** (survival) modeling (e.g. Cox, DeepSurv)
* Incorporate **text or imaging modalities** (clinical notes, imaging data)
* Real-time streaming pipelines for live health monitoring
* Front-end React dashboard for interactive exploration
* Multi-task modeling (simultaneous prediction of multiple outcomes)
* Model explainability enhancements like counterfactual analysis
